I have this small program which takes input from stdin sample.c

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
int l=0;    
scanf("%d",&l);
printf("\n%d",l);
}
ofcourse! compiled it: cc sample.c and got a.out and i am trying to run it via php like

$runcmd = "./a.out > output.txt";
exec($runcmd,$outp); 
print_r($outp);
my problem is i dont have any idea how to give input to this program so that scanf can read that? please help me here!

googling gave some tips like proc_open, popen .... but i couldn't make it.

Thanks in Advance.2

take a look at popen http://se1.php.net/popen

it works a bit like fopen, and when using fwrite, insted of writing to a file you can write to a prosses stdin insted.

$runcmd = "./a.out > output.txt";
$process_stdin = popen($runcmd, 'w');
fwrite($process_stdin, "text to send to process");
pclose($process_stdin);
